# Write a program that asks a user to enter the radius of a circle 
# and prints the area and perimeter of the circle

# Set the value of Pi to be 22/7

# Hints: the power operator allows you to square a number
# e.g. 2 ** 2 = 4

# Output:
# > Enter a circle radius: 7
# > Circle area: 154.0
# > Circle perimeter: 44.0
